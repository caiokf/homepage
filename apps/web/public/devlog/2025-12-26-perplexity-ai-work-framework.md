Perplexity just released a 44-page white paper detailing how they use AI at work. Here's my take on their advice.

They focus on removing friction first, not speed. AI handles cognitive overhead like email summaries, meeting condensation, and automated research. Then they scale thinking by using AI for deep research that compares sources and surfaces contradictions.

Their approach designs systems rather than individual tasks. Research flows into strategy docs, which flow into content and decisions. They distinguish between assistants (help you think) and agents (help you execute).

They also use AI to document outputs automatically and generate performance reviews from data. Their core thesis: AI doesn't replace effort, it removes friction and multiplies results.

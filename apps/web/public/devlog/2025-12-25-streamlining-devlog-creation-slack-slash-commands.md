I've been experimenting with Slack's interactive slash commands to completely overhaul how I create dev log entries. Instead of opening up my editor and wrestling with markdown formatting, I can now just type `/devlog` followed by a quick idea directly in Slack.

The magic happens through Trigger.dev integration. When I hit that slash command, it kicks off a workflow that takes my rough message, sends it to an LLM, and transforms it into a properly formatted dev log entry with title, tags, and clean markdown. Slack's interactivity features handle the async response perfectly.

The friction of creating dev log entries was killing my consistency. Now I can capture ideas the moment they hit me, whether I'm on mobile or desktop. What used to be a 10-minute formatting task is now a 30-second Slack message.

Next up: adding image support so I can include screenshots just by dropping them in the message.

Been playing with Cloudflare Workers and it seems very AI-friendly. Lately this has been my main criteria to decide which tech stak I use. The edge computing model clicks quickly with LLMs, and they understand the Workers runtime pretty well, how to deploy, configure, etc.

The one hiccup? LLMs took a while to figure out how to run wrangler, get it installed. A few rounds of back and forth on how to install it and run it. I guess documentation and training materials were not so up to date. Not as smooth as vercel for example.

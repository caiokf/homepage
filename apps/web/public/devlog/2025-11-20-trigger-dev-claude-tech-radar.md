Playing around with Trigger.dev to automate feedback on my personal tech radar blip descriptions. The setup was surprisingly smooth.

What caught me off guard was how well Claude Code understood Trigger.dev's workflow patterns. It picked up on the job definitions, event handling, and deployment structure without much hand-holding. The MCP integration felt natural too, like Claude had been working with these tools for years.

The whole experience reminded me why I love experimenting with new automation tools. When the AI assistant actually gets the domain-specific patterns, the development flow becomes almost conversational. You describe what you want, it suggests the implementation, and things just work.

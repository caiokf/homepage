GitButler has been giving me grief lately. The merge conflicts keep getting messier, and I can't tell if it's the tool or my workflow that's causing the issues.

Going to give GitKraken a shot, especially their CLI integration. The visual merge conflict resolution looks promising, and I've heard good things about how it handles complex branching scenarios.

I saw this analogy somewhere and loved it: LLMs are like deep sea divers, and contexts are like air tanks.

Push them too deep without proper context management, and they'll run out of air and drown. Their outputs become nonsensical garbage.

But manage their context well? They can explore incredible depths.

Started experimenting with agent workflows for compliance management. The agents run on CI/CD or cron, validating service docs, tracking vendor inventory, and mapping integrations.

Each compliance snapshot gets tied to a commit SHA, creating an audit trail that maps compliance status to code changes. No more scrambling before audits or reconstructing what existed months ago.

AI changes everything about developer experience. Here's what works.

**Use standard tools.** TypeScript, React, Postgres. Don't fight the training set with exotic frameworks.

**Tests beat prompts.** Agents fix broken tests better than they follow your instructions. Write tests with clear, descriptive names.

**Simple code wins.** Every abstraction makes your codebase harder for AI to understand. Put the context agents need in the code itself.

**Document decisions.** Why this architecture? Why this approach? If it's not in the codebase, the agent can't see it.

With AI, writing code becomes reading code. Write for your AI pair programmer.

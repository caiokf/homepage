I've been experimenting with Slack's interactive slash commands to improve how I create dev log entries. Instead of opening up my editor and wrestling with markdown formatting, I can now just type `/devlog` followed by a quick idea directly in Slack.

The magic happens through Trigger.dev integration. When I hit that slash command, it kicks off a workflow that takes my rough message, sends it to an LLM, and transforms it into a properly formatted dev log entry with title, tags, and clean markdown. Slack's interactivity features handle the async response perfectly.

Now I can capture ideas the moment they hit me, whether I'm on mobile or desktop. What used to be a 10-minute formatting task is now a 30-second Slack message.

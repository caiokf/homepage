Been exploring Cloudflare Workers and I'm impressed by how AI-friendly the platform is. The edge computing model clicks quickly with LLMs, and they understand the Workers runtime pretty well.

Deployment is refreshingly simple once you get going. The whole serverless edge approach just makes sense, and the performance is solid.

The one hiccup? Getting Wrangler (their CLI tool) installed properly took more AI prompts than expected. Not sure if it's the Node.js ecosystem complexity or just documentation gaps, but it wasn't the smooth experience I hoped for.

Once past that hurdle though, the developer experience is pretty great. Might be worth the initial setup friction for the deployment simplicity alone.

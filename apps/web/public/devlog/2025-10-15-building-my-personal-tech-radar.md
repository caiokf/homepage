I'm building my own personal tech radar, inspired by ThoughtWorks. Capture a snapshot of my current tech stack and revisit it yearly to see how the landscape shifts.

## The Plan

Map out tools, frameworks, and practices across four rings: adopt, trial, assess, and hold. My technical opinion frozen in time.

Yearly updates feel right. Long enough for meaningful change, short enough to stay relevant.

## Starting Fresh

I would like to reconstruct previous years, but that sounds like a rabbit hole. Will start now and build forward, see how it goes.

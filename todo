XXXX write unit tests for the geometry files
- simplify getRingLabelsOnSeparators, and how to render ring labels, now that there is no angle involved, it is always on the horizantal line separators
- radar legend needs to be inside the tech radar container
- radar container should not have border or background color, or drop shadows
- radar search should be renamed search background
- we need a component BlipList, not quadrant table
- get rid of models/types in favour of putting those types where it belongs (inside geometry files)

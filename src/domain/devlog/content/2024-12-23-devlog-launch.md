Migrated from traditional blog posts to a dev log format. The idea is to document what I'm working on more frequently - experiments, debugging sessions, learnings - rather than polished articles.

The contribution matrix at the top is inspired by GitHub's activity graph. Each cell represents a week, with intensity based on entry count. Click a week to filter entries.

Built with Vue 3 and some light D3 inspiration for the visual design.
